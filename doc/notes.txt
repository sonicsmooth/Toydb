Todo: disable grid plotting if it gets too dense, eg when dynamic zoom is disabled,
grid is set to something small, and user zooms way out


Basic:
Major spacing (distance per grid, goes to kgpu) two boxes showing mm, mils, user enters any value in either box
Enable minor grid
Minors per major
Dynamic zoom


More
Overall zoom factor (goes to kppu)
Zoom range
